Dear <?php echo $username?>, 

Somebody (probably you) has requested a new password for his account in <?php sfConfig::get('app_webname') ?>.

Your new password is "<?php echo $password ?>".

Now you should be able to sign in and change your password.

If you did not request a new password, just ignore this email and continue using your regular password.
